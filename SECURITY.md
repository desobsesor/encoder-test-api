# Implemented Security Measures

This document describes the security measures implemented in the project to prevent code injections and other common attacks.

## Protection Against Code Injection

### 1. Input Validation

- An input validator (`InputValidator`) has been implemented to ensure that user data complies with safe patterns.
- Authentication DTOs (`LoginRequest` and `RegisterRequest`) use Jakarta validation annotations to ensure that data meets specific requirements.
- Regular expressions are used to validate usernames, emails, and other sensitive fields.

### 2. Protection Against SQL Injection

- JPA/Hibernate with parameterized queries is used to prevent SQL injection.
- Hibernate is configured to use prepared statements through `JpaSecurityConfig`.
- Native SQL queries with string concatenation are not used.

### 3. Protection Against XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

- User inputs are sanitized to remove potentially dangerous characters.
- Security HTTP headers such as `X-XSS-Protection` and `Content-Security-Policy` are configured.
- An XSS filter is used to set security headers on each HTTP response.

### 4. Protection Against CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

- CSRF protection from Spring Security is enabled with `CookieCsrfTokenRepository`.
- Only necessary routes are excluded from CSRF protection (such as authentication routes).

### 5. Secure Error Handling

- A global exception handler is implemented that does not reveal sensitive information.
- Validation errors are handled appropriately without exposing internal system details.

## Implemented Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Routes are protected by default and only those that need to be public are explicitly allowed.
2. **Multi-Layer Validation**: Validation is performed both in DTOs and services.
3. **Data Sanitization**: Inputs are cleaned to remove dangerous characters.
4. **Security Headers**: HTTP headers are configured to enhance browser security.
5. **Secure Error Handling**: Technical details are not exposed in error messages.

## Additional Recommendations

- Keep dependencies updated to avoid known vulnerabilities.
- Conduct periodic security audits.
- Implement penetration testing to verify the effectiveness of security measures.
- Consider implementing an intrusion detection system.
